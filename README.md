# Spore-Space-Stage-Taxes

Made with the Spore ModAPI SDK.

Gives you sporebucks every 2 minutes, you get more the bigger your empire is.
You'll still have to hunt for spice in the early game, but later one you'll get enough to not have to farm for purple spice all the time.

As i am pretty new to this advanced kind of coding, i've used both the SporeAutoSave and EmpireInfo mods as reference under some circumstances, credit to them.
